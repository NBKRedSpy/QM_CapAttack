# Quasimorph Cap Attacks

![thumbnail icon](media/thumbnail.png)

Limits enemy units to a maximum of two *melee* attacks per turn.  This affects fast moving units such as spiders that have four AP.

For example, a four AP unit like a spider can still move up to four spaces, but it can only use up to two of its four AP to attack.  

Examples:
* Move 4, Attack 0
* Move 0, Attack 2
* Move 2, Attack 2

This only affects melee attacks and not ranged attacks.

# Vs. Game Difficulty
This differs from the game's difficulty settings as it does not reduce the total number of AP's, just the max melee attacks.

# Save
