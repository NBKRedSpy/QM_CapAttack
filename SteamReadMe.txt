[h1]Quasimorph Cap Attacks[/h1]


Limits enemy units to a maximum of two [i]melee[/i] attacks per turn.  This affects fast moving units such as spiders that have four AP.

For example, a four AP unit like a spider can still move up to four spaces, but it can only use up to two of its four AP to attack.

Examples:
[list]
[*]Move 4, Attack 0
[*]Move 0, Attack 2
[*]Move 2, Attack 2
[/list]

This only affects melee attacks and not ranged attacks.

[h1]Vs. Game Difficulty[/h1]

This differs from the game's difficulty settings as it does not reduce the total number of AP's, just the max melee attacks.

[h1]Save[/h1]

Save to add or remove at anytime.
